================================

Gradle plugin to setup common needs for Netflix OSS projects

This plugin is to support projects in the NetflixOSS org (and it isn't meant to be used elsewhere). It is at its essence
just a combination of other plugins that are common to all NetflixOSS projects, with some additional configuration. The
primary responsibilities is to:

  * Provide release process
  * Configure publishing
  * Recommend license headers
  * Set defaults for javadoc formatting

This project could be used as an example of how a "project plugin" could work. A "project plugin" is a Gradle plugin that
provides consistency across many projects, e.g. in a Github org or an enterprise.

  * com.netflix.nebula:nebula-publishing-plugin - for producing a jar, source jar, javadoc jar with metadata about how it was produced.
